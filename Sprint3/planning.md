| Building 1 |1|
| Building 2 |2|
| Building 3 |3|
| Building 4 |4|
| Backbone   |0|

* VoIP phone numbers and prefix digits schema

| Building | Prefix Digits Schema |
| :------: | :----------: |
| Building 1 |2...|
| Building 2 |9...|
| Building 3 |3...|
| Building 4 |4...|
| Building 5 |7...|



* DNS Domain Names

| Building | DNS Domain Name |
| :------: | :----------: |
| Building 1 |rcomp-21-22-df-g4|
| Building 2 |building-2.rcomp-21-22-df-g4|
| Building 3 |building-3.rcomp-21-22-df-g4|
| Building 4 |building-4.rcomp-21-22-df-g4|
| Building 5 |building-5.rcomp-21-22-df-g4|

* NS (Name Server) records

| Building | DNS Name Server |
| :------: | :----------: |
| Building 1 |ns.rcomp-20-21-di-g3|
| Building 2 |ns.building-2.rcomp-21-22-df-g4|
| Building 3 |ns.building-3.rcomp-21-22-df-g4|
| Building 4 |ns.building-4.rcomp-21-22-df-g4|
| Building 5 |ns.building-5.rcomp-21-22-df-g4|

* The IPv4 node address of the DNS name server of each DNS domain

| Building | IPv4 node address |
| :------: | :----------: |
| Building 1 |172.17.33.2|
| Building 2 |172.17.36.162|
| Building 3 |172.17.37.194|
| Building 4 |172.17.38.130|
| Building 5 |172.17.39.131|

IPv4 node address of the DNS name server per building

| Network | DHCP Pool name |
|:---:|:---:|
| BuildingX_GF | XFIRST/XGROUND |
| BuildingX_FF | XSECOND | 
| BuildingX_WIFI | XWIFI |
| BuildingX_VOIP | XVoIP |  

where X represents the building number
