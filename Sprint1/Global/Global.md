## Building 1
##General Description
In the fiber optic cable it will be all mono-mode optical fiber, because this cable can have a higher speed  compared to copper cables and higher distance and higher data rates compared to Multimode optical fibre.  
In the copper cables they will follow the 568A wiring standard.
In the floors we used CAT-7 copper cable because it has a higher frequency than the CAT-6 copper cable, and the equipments for the compatibility are more affordable than the fiber optic ones.  
The Consolidation Points, and the Horizontal Cross-Connects will have some available connections so that in the future the floor wants to have more outlets.

##General Description
The campus requires 562.03 m of optic fibre cable.
In addition to the connections from building 1 to all other buildings (2,3 and 4), there will also be a connection from building 2 to 3, from 2 to 4, from 3 to 4 and because in case there is damage in one of the links the other connections will compensate the lost one.

####1.0.7
The room have 14.41 m^2 of area , so in order to satisfy the rooms, we needed to put 4 outlets.In this room we added an access point with the channel 1 because it was the most central room so that it creates a wireless local area network in the area, and it could reach all the rooms with no concerns.
####1.0.8
The room have 23.91 m^2 of area, so in order to satisfy the room, we needed to put 6 outlets.In this room we added a Consolidation point with 1 patch panels  of 48 ports in a telecommunications' enclosure 19' because of the high ammount of outlets in the area.

####2.0.1
This room has 8.74m^2 of area, this room is a storage area that may be used to house a cross-connect, no network outlets are required.

This room has
a Horizontal cross-connect (HC) which provides cable connections to end user outlets at the work area on the floor and its in a
telecommunications enclosures 19'' rack. The HC has patch panel with 48 ports.

The room has an Intermediate cross-connect (IC) which connects to the Main cross-connect (MC) located in building 1. The IC has patch panel with 12 ports.
####2.0.2
This room has 31.62m^2 of area, so in order to satisfy the room, we needed to put 8 outlets.
####2.0.3
This room has 87.50m^2 of area, so in order to satisfy the room, we needed to put 18 outlets.
####2.0.4, 2.0.5 and 2.0.6
This room has 28.15m^2 of area, so in order to satisfy the rooms, we needed to put 6 outlets.

In 2.0.4 room, I choose to place the access-point (it's the most "centered" room of the floor) so it can
cover all the floor with wireless (the access-point has approximately a 50 meters diameter circle coverage). This access point is on channel number 1.

This room also has a consolidation point due to the high outlet density. The consolidation point has a patch panel
with 48 ports in a telecommunications enclosures 19'' rack.
###Equipment used:
In this floor we used cooper cable cat-7 to connect the outlets to the Horizontal cross-connect, to connect the access-point and the
respective outlets to the Consolidation point. We used optic fibre to connect the Intermediate cross-connect (in first floor) to the Horizontal cross-connect of the second floor.

##Floor 1(First Floor)
![Floor](Floor11201021.jpg)

####4.1.1
This room has 81.19m^2 of area, so in order to satisfy the room, we needed to put 18 outlets.
####4.1.2
This room has 34.88m^2 of area, so in order to satisfy the room, we needed to put 8 outlets.
####4.1.3 to 4.1.5
Each room has 28.29m^2 of area, so in order to satisfy the rooms, we needed to put 6 outlets each.
In room 4.1.5 we have a Consolidation Point as this room is surrounded by a lot of outlets.
The consolidation point has a patch panel with 48 ports in a telecommunications enclosures 19'' rack.
In room 4.1.5 we added an access point because it was the most central room so that it could reach to all the rooms. The access point in this floor is on channel 1.

####4.1.4
This room has 30.56m^2 of area, so in order to satisfy the room, we needed to put 8 outlets.
####4.1.6
This room has 7.13m^2 of area.
In this room we placed a Intermediate Cross-Connect and a Horizontal Cross-Connect of the floor.
The Intermediate cross-connect has patch panel with 48 ports.
####4.1.7
This room has 55.01m^2 of area, so in order to satisfy the room, we needed to put 12 outlets.
###Equipment used:
We opted to use optic fibre to connect the Intermediate cross-connect, Horizontal cross-connect and the Main cross-connect. In this floor we chose CAT7 copper cables to connect outlets to the  Horizontal cross-connect, to connect the access-point and the
the other outlets to the Consolidation point.
